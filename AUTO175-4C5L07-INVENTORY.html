            ## Exercise 1: Working with the Inventory File
            
            ### Requirements
            
            Before you begin you need to understand:
            
            - How to use debug in Ansible playbooks to explore task flow
            
            ### Scenario
            
            In this lab, you will learn how to use the rich functionality of an Ansible inventory file

            ### Objectives
            
            At the end of this lab you will be able to:
            
            - Create categories in the inventory file for grouping like hosts
            
            - Group repeated host variables together in their own section of the inventory file
            
            - Add host-specific variables to the inventory file
            
            - Use variables to conditionally run tasks based on learned information

            ## Exercise 2: Organizing Ansible Inventory Files
            
            ### Requirements
            
            Before you begin you need to understand:
            
            - How the basic inventory (hosts) file works to control which devices are serviced by the tasks in the Ansible playbook
            
            ### Scenario
            
            In this lab, you will learn how to build to expand the role of the inventory file, while ultimately make it simpler and easier to manage
            
            ### Objectives
            
            At the end of this lab you will be able to:
            
            - Understand how to use the group_vars and host_vars directories to move group-specific and host-specific information out of the inventory file and into specialized files

            ## Exercise 3: Securing Credentials with Ansible Vault
            
            ### Requirements
            
            Before you begin you need to understand:
            
            - How passwords can be aggregated and stored in group_var files for convenience
            
            ### Scenario
            
            In this lab, you will learn how to build to use Ansible to encrypt files, especially files that store passwords
            
            ### Objectives
            
            At the end of this lab you will:
            
            - Understand how to keep passwords and other sensitive data private in your Ansible playbook and inventory files

            ## Click-to-Paste Shortcuts
            
            In the following lab steps, you will be instructed to create various files.  You can use the available click-to-paste shortcuts on the next pages to avoid creating these new files by hand.  In general, this is not recommended because it is beneficial to manually add these files.  You will become more familiar with the individual directives as well as the overall syntax.  Making mistakes in the lab will lead to troubleshooting that further increases understanding and familiarity.
            
            However, it is acknowledged that some students have poor typing skills and that spending time typing and retyping commands and directivies can be very frustrating.  For these students, shortcuts are available that bypass all the typing and perform the specific action described in the student lab guide.
            
            **TL;DR:** In the following lab steps, you will have the option to create files and run commands manually, or you can choose click-to-paste shortcuts.  Don't choose the shortcuts.
